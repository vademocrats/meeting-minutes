## Discussion

### On the issue about offline strategies:
1. We should try to identify who those people are?
2. Revise guidance to electronic absentee tool
3. How do we offset the costs of a tool?

### Thoughts about reaching out to the community in general:
1. Who their local candidates are? If someone doesn't have contact with their local CD or Committee; it would be good to have a centralized resource to see who's on my ballot? Sample ballots at minimum viable product.
2. Instead of reinventing the wheel, technology items should be included in the agenda of other existing subgroups to improve communication within the structure.

### Additional thoughts on training:
1. Facebook and social media training
2. Other best practices: VAN and knowledge sharing
